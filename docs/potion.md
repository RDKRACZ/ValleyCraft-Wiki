## Lingering Powder Addon Guide

_[Return to Main Page](README.md)_

I made this addon mostly for myself but thought I should upload it since others might like it too. I never bother killing the End Dragon in my world, but I still wanted a way to get lingering potions, so this serves as my solution. **This requires ValleyCraft 1.1 or above to function!**
